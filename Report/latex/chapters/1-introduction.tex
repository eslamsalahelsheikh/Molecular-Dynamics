\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

Molecular dynamics simulations are becoming an essential part of modern technology, because
they allow to study the behavior of complex systems in a controlled way. The simulation of
molecular systems is a very complex task, because the number of atoms in a system can be
very large. Therefore, the simulation of a system requires a lot of computational power. In
the last years, the computational power of computers has increased dramatically. This
development has led to the fact that molecular dynamics simulations are now possible for
systems with millions of atoms. However, the simulation of such systems is still a very
demanding task. Therefore, the simulation of such systems is usually done on supercomputers
or clusters of computers.  

In this report, we will discuss the design and Implementation of a molecular 
dynamics simulations for atoms and molecules. We will also discuss the different potential
forces that are used in the simulations, and how they are implemented, initializing atomic 
systems in random positions and preserve the atoms from evaporating using Thermostates, how
to make the simulation run faster by using only neighbor list search, and how to parallelize
the simulation using MPI.
