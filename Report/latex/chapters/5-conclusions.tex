\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
In this course, we have investigated how we can implement such simple molecular dynamic simulations using different potential forces, and how we can address the problem of first initialization of the atoms in space in totally random positions and save the system from evaporation or melting using thermostats, and also we saw how we can improve the computations for these potentials using only a neighbor search algorithm, and in the end we saw how we can make a scaling of the system to a larger number of atoms using the parallelization of the code using MPI.
